An application for sending emails to a list of names specified in an excel document. Written for TAG Directed Study Program 2015-2016

This is a program that allows you to write a message and send it to a list of emails specified in an excel document. 
It uses an email and password supplied by the user - if you want to run this yourself you will have to edit the authentication 
file accordingly, and also allow external applications to access your email (a setting in gmail).
